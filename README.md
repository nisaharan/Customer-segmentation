# Customer-segmentation

Customer segmentation is a marketing technique companies use  to identify and group users who display similar characteristics. For instance, if you visit Starbucks only during the summer to purchase cold beverages, you can be segmented as a “seasonal shopper” and enticed with special promotions curated for  the summer season.

Data scientists usually build unsupervised machine learning algorithms such as K-Means clustering or hierarchical clustering to perform customer segmentation. These models are great at identifying similar patterns between user groups that often go unnoticed by the human eye.

In this repo, I will use K-Means clustering to perform customer segmentation on the e-commerce dataset we downloaded earlier.

Steps I will be taking to accomplish the task,

Reading csv files with PySpark
Exploratory Data Analysis with PySpark
Grouping and sorting data
Performing arithmetic operations
Aggregating datasets
Data Pre-Processing with PySpark
Working with datetime values
Type conversion
Joining two dataframes
The rank() function
PySpark Machine Learning
Creating a feature vector
Standardizing data
Building a K-Means clustering model
Interpreting the model
